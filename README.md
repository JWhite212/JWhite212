# 👋 Hi there, I'm Jamie White

I'm a passionate and curious programmer with a strong foundation in computer science and a particular interest in backend development, full-stack applications, and system integration.

🎓 I hold a BSc (Hons) in Computer Science (2:1) and am currently completing an MSc in Advanced Computer Science at the University of Kent. My work spans mobile apps, IoT, RESTful APIs, and cloud platforms.

💼 **Actively seeking**: Graduate / Junior Software Engineer roles where I can apply my skills, collaborate in meaningful teams, and continue growing as a developer.
